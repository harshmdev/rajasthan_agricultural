#About Dataset

The dataset provided focuses on agricultural data in the state of Rajasthan, India from 2018 to 2019. It consists of four CSV files: Crop_Production_Data.csv, Water_Usage_Data.csv, Soil_Analysis_Data.csv, and Crop_Price_Data.csv. These files offer valuable information for researchers and data scientists in the agricultural sector, enabling them to analyze and model various aspects of agricultural practices and market dynamics in Rajasthan.

The Crop_Production_Data.csv file contains information on crop production, including district, crop type, season, area (hectares), yield (quintals), and production (tonnes). This data allows for the study of crop productivity, seasonal variations, and identification of production patterns across different districts.

The Water_Usage_Data.csv file provides insights into water usage in agriculture, including district, crop type, irrigation method used, water consumption (liters/ha), and water availability (liters/ha). This data can be used to analyze water management practices, assess irrigation methods' efficiency, and study the impact of water availability on crop production.

The Soil_Analysis_Data.csv file contains soil quality information such as area, soil type, pH, percentage of organic matter, nitrogen content (kg/ha), phosphorus content (kg/ha), and potassium content (kg/ha). This data is valuable for studying soil properties, assessing soil fertility, and understanding nutrient content in different soil types in Rajasthan.

The Crop_Price_Data.csv file includes data on crop prices in different markets (mandis) across counties. It includes information such as district, crop type, market, date, and price (INR/100 weight approx). This dataset can be used to study crop price trends, analyze market trends, and develop crop price forecasting models in Rajasthan.

Researchers and data scientists can utilize this dataset for various analyses and studies, including crop productivity analysis and forecasting, research on water management and irrigation optimization, soil fertility assessment and soil health analysis, market analysis and crop price forecasting, evaluation of agricultural policies and interventions, and assessment of the impact of climate change on agriculture in Rajasthan.
